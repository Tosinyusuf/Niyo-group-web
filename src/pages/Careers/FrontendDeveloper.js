        <p>
          We are looking for a Frontend Web Developer who is motivated to
          combine the art of design with the art of programming.
          Responsibilities will include translation of the UI/UX design
          wireframes to actual code that will produce visual elements of the
          application. You will work with the UI/UX designer and bridge the gap
          between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an
          active role on both sides and defining how the application looks as
          well as how it works.
